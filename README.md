- 👋 Hi, I’m @PabloDavidAR, Master's student in Advaced Robotics Technologies
- 👀 I’m interested in deepening my knowledge and gaining experience in various topics:
    - Large projects in C++, Python 
    - Deep Learning techniques, and deeper mathematical background.
    - State-of-art Reinforcement Learning algorithms and implementations.
    - Other Artificial Intelligence related technologies, such as Computer Vision, or Heuristics.
    - Motion Planning, for now in wheeled robots, and soon in Legged robots.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Data Structures & Algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to those topics! Always eager to learn more and more, specially by collaborating in real projects.
