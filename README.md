- 👋 Hi, I’m @PabloDavidAR, currently an Industrial Engineer with a focus in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence
- 👀 I’m interested in deepening my knowledge in various topics:
    - C++, Python, R, and Javascript, having already some knowledge in some of them, and considering that actually in C++ and Python I have an intermediate-high level.
    - Data Science tools.
    - Deep Learning techniques, and deeper mathematical background.
    - Other Artificial Intelligence related technologies, such as Computer Vision, or Heuristics.
    - DevOps and Cloud computing, specially about microservices and container technologies.
    - Front-end, but specially Back-end development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Data Structures & Algorithms, apart from various tools related to some of the previously mentioned topics, such as PyTorch and OpenCV. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to those topics! Always eager to learn more and more, specially when this is done in real projects with other people.
